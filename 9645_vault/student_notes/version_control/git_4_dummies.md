run 
```bash 
git stage .
# get everything ready to commmit
git commit -m "this is a message"
# perform the commit to modify the local repo
git push
# push the commit up to the remote repo
```
for whenever you want to save stuff

version control is cool
- optimisations include: diffs (like diff arrays) to reduce repo size
	- O(repo size) instead O(repo size * commit count)
