A recursive problem is a problem that can be defined in terms of itself.

When translated into an algorithm, this is represented as a subroutine that contains a call to itself from within its own body.

The condition under which a recursive subroutine stops calling itself is known as its **base case**.

The condition under which a recursive subroutine continues to call itself is known as its **general case**.

Whilst recursive algorithms often lead to elegant and readable solutions to problems, they can be memory intensive. This is because each recursive call requires its own set of local variables to be added to the call stack.
