- talk about why graphs are useful
	- give examples
		- friendship graphs
		- relationships
		- maps
		- show some images of graphs
			- (note include some unconnected graphs)
- say what the formal definition is?
	- some nodes (a set V of nodes)
	- some edges connecting the nodes (a set E (or multiset) of pairs of nodes)
- talk about the usual implementations
	- adj list
		- usual implementation when |E| ~ |V|
		- uses O(|E| + |V|) space
		- but adding/removing edges may take up to O(|V|)
	- adj matrix
		- usual implementation when |E| ~ |V|<sup>2</sup>
		- always uses O(|V|<sup>2</sup>) space
		- but allows for O(1) adding/removing edges
